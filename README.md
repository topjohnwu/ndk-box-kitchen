# ndk-box-kitchen

This repo is the kitchen used to create headers and Makefiles for building \*box with the command [`ndk-build`](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/ndk-build.html) in NDK. All scripts in this repo expect to run on Linux, however the generated code and Makefiles can be used on all NDK supported platforms.
